This is an HP-UX output plugin for XMMS.
This plugin is based on the OSS output plugin that comes with XMMS 1.2.10.
A lot of stuff has been stripped out of that plugin and specialized.

It has been tested on a PA-RISC box (C3650) running HP-UX 11.11.

To compile:
	- Edit the Makefile and run make.
	- Type "make install" as root to install the plugin.
